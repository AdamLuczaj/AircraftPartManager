Notes: This project was completed as an assignment for the COMP2404 course at Carleton University. The professors name was Darryl Hill. I will specify what code was written by me and what code was provided by Darryl Hill. Please keep in mind that I understand how the code by professor Darryl works (apart from class.py), it was just sample code provided by the professor when starting the assignment.

Code By Professor Darryl: class.py, Control.cc, Control.h, Date.cc, Date.h, defs.h, main.cc, Makefile, View.cc, View.h
Code By Me: Aircraft.cc, Aircraft.h, Airline.cc, Airline.h, Part.cc, Part.h
Code Modified by Me (Please see comments on the classes for specifics): Array.h
